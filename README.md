# SearchGitHubRepositories



This is a Visual Studio Project, this solution contains two project:

1. Class Library proj with the SearchRepositoryClient, an Helper Class ,that helps us to comunicate with GitHub.

2. ASP. MVC project  including Angualr4 Folder (using angular-cli).

clone the project and runing the MVC Project, the files that needed for angular are already linked  in the _Layout.cshtml file.

for any change in the angulars files you needc to rebuild it in the angular-cli, the output is going to an extra folder named "bundles", in the root folder.
